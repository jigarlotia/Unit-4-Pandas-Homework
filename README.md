# Unit-4-Pandas-Homework
## Whale Portfolio

The objective of this repository is to create a Jupyter Notebook that analyses and visualises the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others. 

The key portfolios compared are:
- Whale Portfolios
- S&P 60 TSX
- My own custom portfolio

## Resources
The resouces used by this notebook can be found in the [Resources](Resources/) Folder which includes the historical data csv files.

In addition it uses three Google Sheets to read the historical data of ASX stocks BHP, WOW and TLS.  They can be found here:

- [BHP Close Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vJilnYxubAwm_nlTrMHsTTo_OE221OH7Bu5lU7oETtY/edit?usp=sharing)
